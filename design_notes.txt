Implementation A:
1. Rule-Based Flat Monte Carlo, if no rule-based move available, then
2. Alpha-beta (copying Ninuki-AB.py ) with timelimit, if reaches timelimit:
3. Random move


Implementation B:
Monte Carlo Tree Search with UCT (Go5, performs better than Go3 only if enough time is given)

Implementation C:
Alpha-Zero
